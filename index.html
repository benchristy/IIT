			<h3>When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
			<p>My Interest in IT started when I was really young, although I didn’t know what it was exactly yet I loved working with electronics. <br> weather it was something I pulled out of a toy or something I had found in my father’s shed I always pulled things apart to find out how they worked.<br>How I got into IT though was as simple as my dad giving me an old IBM computer and from that moment I was hooked.
  </p>
<br>
         <h3>What is my interests in IT?</h3>
         <p>My Interest in IT has always been in the communication side of things (networking). I am fascinated on how many different forms of communication there are now. Whether it’s basic Wi-Fi, to running several VLAN’s on a large network, I love how data is transferred and how we secure it.
We have become so dependent on it now cybersecurity and network professionals are needed more than ever and I am lucky enough that it is where I feel like I am most suited.

		<h4>Why did I choose RMIT?</h4>
		<p>I choose to come to RMIT because they had the course I needed to complete to get into my bachelors in IT which is specializing in networking and cybersecurity through Uni SA.</p>

		<h5>What do I expect to learn through my studies?</h5>	
		<p>I expect to learn the basics of IT and gain a better understanding of the field I am going into as well as gaining knowledge and some experience to excel in my chosen field. And help me push forward in my career.</p>
