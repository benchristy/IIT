			<h3>When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
			<p>My interest in IT started when I was really young, although I didn’t know what it was exactly yet I loved working with electronics. <br> weather it was something I pulled out of a toy or something I had found in my father’s shed I always pulled things apart to find out how they worked.<br>How I got into IT though was as simple as my dad giving me an old IBM computer and from that moment I was hooked.
  </p>

         <h3>What is my interests in IT?</h3>
         <p>My interest in IT has always been in the communication side of things (networking). I am fascinated on how many different forms of communication there are now.<br> Whether it’s basic Wi-Fi, to running several VLAN’s on a large network, I love how data is transferred and how we secure it.<br>We have become so dependent on it now cybersecurity and network professionals are needed more than ever and I am lucky enough that it is where I feel like I am most suited.
</p>	

		<h3>Why did I choose RMIT?</h3>
		<p>I choose to come to RMIT because they had the course I needed to complete to get into my bachelors in IT which is specializing in networking and cybersecurity through Uni SA.</p>
		

		<h3>What do I expect to learn through my studies?</h3>	
		<p>I expect to learn the basics of IT and gain a better understanding of the field I am going into as well as gaining knowledge and some experience to excel in my chosen field.<br> And help me push forward in my career.</p>

<h3>What do these test results mean to me?</h3>
<p>The results of these tests give me the ability to see what kind of person I am.
They give me the ability to see how well work in a team, how well I can empathize with others as well as the best learning styles for me.
</p>
<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>I don’t think these results will affect my behavior in a team environment. I have worked in many teams before, mostly for work and have found it fairly easy.<br> I find that working in team environments is fun, everyone has an opinion and idea and as long as you are all working together it works well.</p>
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>I have found that I am a fairly easy going person when it comes to working with others. You can’t always pick your work colleagues and you have to find ways to make it work. <br>But if I had the choice I would always pick to work with likeminded people like me.</p>
