			<h3>When did my interest in IT start?</h3>
			<p>My Interest in IT started when I was really young, although I didn’t know what it was exactly yet I loved working with electronics, weather it was something I pulled out of a toy or something I had found in my father’s shed I always pulled things apart to find out how they worked.<br>How I got into IT though was as simple as my dad giving me an old IBM computer and from that moment I was hooked.
